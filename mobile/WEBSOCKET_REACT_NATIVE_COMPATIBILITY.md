# WebSocket React Native Compatibility Report

## Summary
‚úÖ The CLOBWebSocketManager is fully compatible with React Native. All tests pass and the implementation works correctly with React Native's WebSocket implementation.

## Key Compatibility Points

### 1. WebSocket API ‚úÖ
- **React Native has built-in WebSocket support** that's compatible with the W3C WebSocket API
- No additional polyfills needed
- Works exactly like browser WebSocket

### 2. Dependencies ‚úÖ
All dependencies are React Native compatible:
- **viem**: Works with React Native (already in package.json)
- **ethers**: Works with React Native (already in package.json)
- **BigInt**: Supported in React Native with proper polyfills (react-native-get-random-values)

### 3. File Imports ‚úÖ
Fixed import paths for React Native's Metro bundler:
- Moved ABI to local constants folder
- Used relative imports that Metro can resolve
- No dynamic imports or require statements

## Implementation Details

### CLOBWebSocketManager Features
1. **Real-time order book updates**
   - OrderPlaced events
   - OrderMatched events
   - OrderCancelled events

2. **Price and volume tracking**
   - PriceUpdate events
   - VolumeUpdate events

3. **User-specific tracking**
   - User order updates
   - User balance updates
   - Trade execution notifications

4. **Automatic reconnection**
   - Exponential backoff
   - Max 5 reconnection attempts
   - Resubscribes to books after reconnection

### React Hooks for Easy Integration

```typescript
// Order book updates
const { orderBook, isConnected } = useOrderBookWebSocket({ bookId: 1 });

// Price ticker for multiple books
const { prices, volumes } = usePriceTicker({ bookIds: [1, 2, 3] });

// User orders and trades
const { userOrders, userTrades } = useUserOrdersWebSocket();

// Real-time trades
const { trades } = useRealtimeTrades({ bookId: 1 });

// Connection status
const { isConnected, reconnect } = useCLOBConnectionStatus();
```

## Test Results

```
‚úÖ CLOBWebSocketManager
  ‚úì should connect to WebSocket
  ‚úì should handle subscription to book
  ‚úì should handle event listeners
  ‚úì should track user address
  ‚úì should handle reconnection
  ‚úì should manage order book cache
  ‚úì should handle BigInt values in events
  ‚úì should clean up on disconnect

‚úÖ CLOBWebSocketManager Integration
  ‚úì should handle complete order flow

‚úÖ React Native Compatibility
  ‚úì should work in React Native environment
  ‚úì should handle React Native WebSocket implementation
  ‚úì should work with viem in React Native
```

## Integration with Mobile App

### 1. In a Screen Component
```tsx
import { useOrderBookWebSocket } from '../hooks/useCLOBWebSocket';

export function TradingScreen() {
  const { orderBook, isConnected, lastUpdate } = useOrderBookWebSocket({ 
    bookId: 1 
  });
  
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Connection: {isConnected ? 'üü¢' : 'üî¥'}</Text>
      <OrderBookDisplay data={orderBook} />
    </View>
  );
}
```

### 2. In the App Provider
```tsx
import { getCLOBWebSocketManager } from './services/CLOBWebSocketManager';

// Initialize once at app startup
const wsManager = getCLOBWebSocketManager();
wsManager.connect();
```

## Performance Considerations

1. **Event Batching**: Multiple updates are batched to prevent excessive re-renders
2. **Memory Management**: Event history limited to 100 events
3. **Selective Subscriptions**: Only subscribe to books that are actively viewed
4. **Cache Management**: Order book cache cleared on unsubscribe

## Known Limitations

1. **Background Mode**: WebSocket may disconnect when app goes to background
   - Solution: Reconnect when app returns to foreground
   
2. **Network Changes**: Connection may be lost during network transitions
   - Solution: Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff

3. **Large Order Books**: Heavy data may impact performance
   - Solution: Implement pagination or depth limiting

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ WebSocket manager implemented and tested
2. ‚úÖ React hooks created for easy integration
3. ‚è≥ Integrate with existing screens
4. ‚è≥ Add connection status indicator to UI
5. ‚è≥ Implement background/foreground handling
6. ‚è≥ Add performance monitoring

## Conclusion

The WebSocket implementation is fully React Native compatible and ready for integration. No compatibility issues were found, and all core functionality works as expected.
